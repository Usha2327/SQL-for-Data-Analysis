# SQL-for-Data-Analysis

This repository contains 6 SQL queries created to analyze an online sales dataset. The goal was to explore sales trends, product performance, and team contributions using SQL.

✅ What I’ve Done
1. Total Sales by Region
Joined sales and geo tables to calculate total revenue per region.

2. Top 5 Products by Sales Amount
Used aggregation on sales and products tables to find the top-selling products.

3. Average Boxes Sold Per Salesperson
Calculated the average number of boxes sold by each salesperson using a join with the people table.

4. Sales by Product Category (Filtered)
Used a subquery to filter and display categories with sales above ₹100,000.

5. Products with or without Sales (LEFT JOIN)
Performed a LEFT JOIN between products and sales to include products even if they had no sales.

6. Sales by Region with RIGHT JOIN
Used a RIGHT JOIN to ensure all sales records were matched with regions, even if the geo info was missing.
